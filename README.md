# Real-Time Facial and Hand Gesture Recognition System

## Overview
This project implements a real-time facial and hand gesture recognition system using computer vision techniques. It utilizes OpenCV for image processing and MediaPipe for hand and facial landmark detection.

## Key Features
Facial Recognition:
Detects faces using Haar cascades and draws bounding boxes around them.
Identifies eyes within detected faces and marks them with 'X' symbols.
Recognizes smiles and highlights them within the facial region.
Hand Gesture Recognition:
Utilizes MediaPipe Hands to detect hand landmarks and draw connections between them.
Provides real-time tracking of hand movements and gestures.

## Technologies Used
OpenCV: Image and video processing library.
MediaPipe: Framework for building multimodal applied ML pipelines.
Python: Programming language used for implementation.

## Usage
Ensure your webcam is connected and properly configured.
Run the gesture_recognition.py script.
Facial and hand gestures will be detected and visualized in real-time.

## Future Improvements
Enhance accuracy and robustness of gesture recognition algorithms.
Implement gesture-based control for interactive applications.
Explore integration with augmented reality frameworks.
